We're a community of people who enjoy playing video games and reading books together and interested in creating a community for games and other media. The game industry is divided into a few industries, and with those divides there's a great opportunity for those who are interested in working together and sharing their knowledge.\\n\\nJourneys is a space for game developers, designers, and players to come together, collaborate, and help each other become aware of each other's perspectives and experiences.\\n\\n\\nGames can be a great source of inspiration for new game developers. In this spirit, here are some games I've worked on recently:\\n\\n\\nBattleship - A great game of survival horror.\\n\\n\\nChaos in Space -\"},\n",
